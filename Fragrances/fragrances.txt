I have made this formulation for DIY deoderant:

•	Vetiver – 100 uL
•	Black Pepper – 300 uL
•	Bergamot – 500 uL
•	Clove – 100 uL
•	Cedarwood – 300 uL

It is ok.  The original formulation was:
•	Vetiver – 200 uL
•	Black Pepper – 100 uL
•	Bergamot – 200 uL
•	Clove – 100 uL
•	Cedarwood – 200 uL
Which I didn't really like, so I tried the other version, but it's just ok.

The vetiver is not really the direction I want to go -- it is too medicinal/clean smelling.  I want something musky and masculine -- pleasant smelling, but not flowery at all.  Of these fragrances, black pepper and bergamot are the two I think are most in the right ballpark.  What other fragrances should I be considering?
